# Books Log
A place for me to record what I read and highlight the parts that resonate with me.  
One day, I may organize these notes into articles.

# The Staff Engineer's Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change
I read the Mandarin version, so the page numbers may differ.

## Memo
### 1
- **Local Maximum (P11):** This is something I often did when leading a project. I would focus on achieving the best outcome within a limited scope. However, it’s a good challenge to think more broadly and aim for the best overall impact across a wider scope.
- **Considering business realities when making technical decisions (P14):** One of my past supervisors also advised me to think more about the product when making technical decisions. It’s crucial to take the product perspective into account, as this mindset helps elevate your thinking to a higher level.
- **Staff engineers need to take accountability and lead through ambiguity, chaos, and difficult problems (P16, 17):** When facing complex problems, breaking them down into smaller parts makes them clearer and easier to tackle.
- **The easier you are to understand, the smoother your work becomes (P18):** I’ve noticed that the more clearly I can explain my ideas and make my presentations easy to understand, the more smoothly my work progresses.
